### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sotiris and I'm a Process Engineer by trade, working in semiconductors. I come from Greece but I live and work in Belgium. 

I just like to **code** and automate things. I practiced C/C++/Java/HTML/CSS/Javascript/SQL during my studies, these days I'm mostly using **Python**.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a tool that combines and analyzes data from mutliple diverse sources in a factory
- ðŸŒ± Currently learning *Data Science* (check out my [Dataquest Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/cap1tan/dataquest-projects)), *Golang*
