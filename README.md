### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a process engineer by trade, working in the field of semiconductors.  

I just like to **code** and automate things. 
I practiced C/C++/Java/HTML/CSS/Javascript/SQL/Matlab during my studies, these days I'm mostly using **Python**.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a few projects:
    - A library to create nice interactive or static graphs of semiconductor wafers
    - A tool that combines and analyzes data from mutliple diverse sources to produce accurate lithographic process windows
    - A smart profile extractor that automatically measures useful parameters from features in XSEM images
- ðŸŒ± Currently studying *AI & Data Science* (postgrad in AI for business & industry, academic year 2024-2025)
