### Hi there 👋

I'm a process engineer by trade, working in semiconductors.  

I just like to **code** and automate things. I practiced C/C++/Java/HTML/CSS/Javascript/SQL/Matlab during my studies, these days I'm mostly using **Python**.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a tool that combines and analyzes data from mutliple diverse sources in a factory
- 🌱 Currently learning *Data Science*
